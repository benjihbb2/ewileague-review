# collab-faircode
A repository for practicing how to review code.

This repository can be improved in several ways; we will focus on some changes to make software FAIR. You find a list of TODOs in `fair-checklis.md`.
This repository provides a template to make your software project more compliant with the FAIR principles. It adopts the recommendations made by the TU Delft Guidelines on Research Software.
